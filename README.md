We will work with different branches.

	- The MASTER branch will never be touch only at the very end, when we are completely done
	- We will have a DEVELOP which is the branch in which we are working
				we will have many branches off DEVELOP -> we merge to DEVELOP only when something is running and has passed all previous tests
	- We will have a branch WRITEUP off MASTER, for the TEX files, and images.
